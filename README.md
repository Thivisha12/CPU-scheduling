# CPU-scheduling
Operating System CPU scheduling
This project is a web-based simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms, created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The simulation aims to help users visualize and understand how different CPU scheduling algorithms work in an operating system.
Features
Simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms:
 First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
 Shortest Job Next (SJN)
 Priority Scheduling
 Round Robin (RR)

Technologies
 JavaScript: Used for the core simulation logic
 HTML: Provides the structure for the web pages
 CSS: Used for styling the web pages and animations
